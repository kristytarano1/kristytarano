Hello, my name is **Kristy Tarano** and I am originally from Cuba. I studied **International Relations** in Miami,Florida at Florida International University and graduated in 2018. 

In 2011 I finished my **Master's Degree in Curriculum & Instruction with concentration in ESOL** in Concordia University- Portland, OR. A few years later, I decided to change my career path and went for a **Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering** from Keiser University and graduated in 2017. 

Since my graduation as a software engineer, I have been developing software, creating websites, full stack applications, and getting expertise in AWS services. I recently got the following AWS certifications: [**AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=3&t=c&d=2019-09-10&ci=AWS00993439), and [**AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate**](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=1&t=c&d=2019-10-17&ci=AWS00993439).

Soon I will be getting my Developer AWS certifications and in 2020 I am planning to start my **Master's Degree in Computer Science**.
